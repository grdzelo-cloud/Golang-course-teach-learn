# Go Introduction

## What is Go?

- Go is across-platform, **open source**("Open source" refers to a type of software in which the source code is made available to the public.") programming language

- Go can be used to create high-performance applications

- Go is a fas, statically typed, compiled language known fo its simplicity and efficiency

- Go was developed at Google by [Robert Griesemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer)

- Go's syntax is similar to c++

# what is Go Used For?

- Web Development (server-side)
- Developing network-based programs
- Developing cross-platform software (multi-platform software ) (**cps**) enterprise applications
- Cloud-native development

# Why Use Go?

- Go is fun and easy to learn

- Go has fast run time and compiled time

- Go supports concurrency

- Go has memory management

- Go works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
